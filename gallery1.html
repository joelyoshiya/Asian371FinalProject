      Incense burner

    <h3 style="text-align:center;">An Ethereal Multiplicity of Being</h3>
    <p> The sheer complexity, depth, and nuance to this piece requires a repetition of prolonged observations over all sides of its surfacescape. From the "front" of the burner,
      we get to form the bodily image of a Tiger, balanced on its front paws, staring intently at the observer. Balance is a key part of this view, as rings on either side stand parallel
      to the ground. A Lotus flower on top gives further complexity, as we realize this Incense Burner is not embodying a singular bodily surface, but multiple. By rotating, as seen in the images, we
      gain consciousness of the four-sided nature of the object, suggesting a discontinuous geometry that disrupts the idea of one fluid bodily entity. One the "sides" of the body, we see a body
      in motion. Two staggered paws appear, suggesting movement by this tiger, with the head invisible, with the tail in our face. This process repeats itself on the opposite site, while the stability
      and resting positions also reflects a symmetrical view on its opposite side, with the only differences being the vibrant, lush, and gentle shading of the Jade. From aquamarine, to a rosy pink at the
      top, the Tiger achieves counterpoint with the fragile and elegant lotus flower, while the resting and prawling positions of represented in the incense burner present a duality of motion
      and stasis. It is in this multiplicity of states, qualities, and bodies that the incense burner conveys a spectacle of otherworldy imagination, bedazzling the viewer and causing deep contemplation
      of the unknown. We can imagine a user, absorbing in its presence while under the transcient aroma of the incense, lifted high into the heavens.</p>
