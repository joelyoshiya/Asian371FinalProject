    <p>Imagine you are Shen Zhou, an early Ming Dynasty scholar who lived in Suzhou. You've tragically
      lost his most prized possessions, such as vases, incense burners, silk robes, and other artifacts
      in a violent fire that burned your living quarters to the ground. You're a man of culture who chooses dwell
      in places that stimulate your aesthetic taste, so you commission artisans, potters, and artists from both
      near and far to recreate your dream dwelling space. Currently, you are choosing your next work to commission,
      and narrow down to some work of Jade, pottery from the specialists at the imperial Jingdezhen kiln,
      or procuring the ceramic craftsmen of white porcelain found in the southern land of Dehua.
