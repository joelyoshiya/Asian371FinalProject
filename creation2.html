    <h1>How Jade is Worked:</h1>
  </header>
  <p>Jade, a prized gem that literati frequently peppered into their prose, often as simile for beauty, purity,
    and other positive meanings. Jade, unlike clay, can not be shaped by hand and requires tenuous cutting. As you will see,
    the work is done by skilled craftsmen, and often painstaking labor is put into the final product. Consider the shape, geometry,
    and luster that will be achieve, and what figure would best embellish the qualities of Jade. Imagine what vessel if any, such as a vase,
    incense burner, spittoon, or the like would best fit the aesthetics and material characteristics of Jade.</p>
