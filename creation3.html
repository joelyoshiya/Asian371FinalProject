    <h1>Dehua Porcelain: "White from China"</h1>
  </header>
  <p>Dehua, found in Fujian China, is a historic site famous for the production of a special type of porcelain, referred to
    French as "<i>Blanc De Chine</i>," or White of China. This white whare has a brilliant white sheen, and once glazened gives
    off a luster like ivory or white-jade. Often used to sculpt figurines, or smaller sculptures, various vessels have been shaped
    by this pure and clean clay of the region. Imagining the purity and brilliant simplicity of the porcelain take shape, what forms, vessels,
    or embellishments do you imagine or desire for the handiwork of Dehua crafstmen?</p>
