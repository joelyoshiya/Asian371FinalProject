      Vase with Nine Peaches
      <br>Qing dynasty

    <h3 style="text-align:center;">Lust of Spring on White Porcelain</h3>
    <p>On first glance, what is immediately absorbed is the voluminuous, rotund nature of this vase. Its curvature suggests the sensual feminine figure, evoking
      visceral pleasure. This characteristic is with intention, and interplays with the image painted on the vessel to engage in a resonating metaphorical space. As the
      gaze travels to the painting, light and delicate hues form the materialization of a Peach Tree, with flowers budding and plump, nearly ripe peaches weighing the branches down to the bottom
      surface of the vessel. The uniformity in geometry presentes a circular symmetry, forcing the observer to have the impetus to turn it around, while at the same moment seeking to find the root
      of the Peach Tree in the painting, or possibly more peaches on the surface. This implied and irrestible desire to turn is eventually met, where more leaves, fruit, and flowers adorn the vessel.
      A brief blank space on one section of the perimeter suggests the transcience of this scenery, that the peach will one day drop from the tree, as will the flower and the leaves. This pauses the impulse
      to turn the vessel round and round, and also symbollically forces the observer to question the transcience of their lust for wordly things, as symbolized in the feminine language of the body,
      and peach tree imagery decorating the vase. One could imagine flowers gently resting at the top, further conveying the youth, beauty of the Peach tree in spring, and drawing out the purity in the
      white porcelain even more. As the flower withers, the aftertaste of contemplative pause is fully realized. Such is the nature of a vase that both accelerates and slows our desires. </p>
