    <h3 style="text-align:center;">The Dragon and Its Heavenly Smokestack</h3>
    <p> Composed of white clay, the vessel is a champion of simplicity. Yet in its simplicity, variances in surface and form are further magnified,
      giving an inspiring affect. Consider first the general proportions of the vase, with a sort of "Goose Neck," and a slight enlargement in girth at the opening. Also notice the sudden
      rise in curvature at the bottom of the "neck", creating a natural interval between the top and bottom halves. These components create a dynamic, living image of a vase, huffing and puffing,
      forcing air through its thin neck and into the sky above it. The bottom half, weighed and ballooning, has a sensation of tension about its surface, further suggesting the directionality of
      object. Then the dragon wrapping around the neck redefines the piece once again. Given gargantuine scale to the piece, the observer can gain the relative scale of the piece, as displayed in the dragon,
      to imagine the vase reaching high into the sky, overwhelming any Pagoda or Tower on city's surface. Suddenly, we are on the ground of the vessel, craning our necks and running to the opposite side,
      trying to hide from the Dragon's gaze, to then reach the other and stand in the midst of its terrifying grin. The curvature of its body also suggesting another vector of direction, in this case spiraling
      about the neck of the vase. As a collective unit, we experience both simplicity, but also can explore a massive imaginary space presented by the dragon and goose-necked nature of the piece,
      making it a pleasure and playful engagement of mind and body.
